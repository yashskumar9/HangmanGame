# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a secret word one letter at a time. Itâ€™s a fun, interactive game that sharpens your vocabulary and logical thinking. Traditionally played by two players, this version has been coded in Python, allowing a single player to enjoy the game while competing against the computer.

## About the Game

In this Python implementation of Hangman:
- The player tries to guess the secret word by suggesting letters.
- Each incorrect guess reveals a part of the hangman figure.
- The game ends when:
  - The player successfully guesses the word, or
  - The entire hangman figure is drawn after a set number of incorrect guesses.

This project serves as a fun way to learn and apply Python concepts like loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation.

## Purpose

This project is designed for beginners who want to:
- Practice coding with Python.
- Build an interactive console-based game.
- Learn concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, and string operations.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. A secret word will be randomly chosen.
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. Win by guessing all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is completed.
